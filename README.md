# Description
node.js modules for executing SqlTool for any database,
or for running HyperSQL database instances under node.js.

Each supported platform has a different Git branch and a different node module.

SqlTool provides a scripting/automation interface and interactive console
interface to JDBC Databases.
HyperSQL database engine is bundled, but you can also access any database by
just downloading the JDBC driver SQL file for the database.

# Usage

If you want to use this product on some other platform (ARM, Apple),
we can probably make that happen if you will test the build.
